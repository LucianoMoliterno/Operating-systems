## TP Delivery No 1: Understanding Process Planning Algorithms.
#### The objective is to understand how short-range process planning works. To do this, each group must manually carry out 4 process planning simulations, each with a different algorithm (two simulations must use non-preemptive algorithms, and the other two with preemptive algorithms). To do this, 6 processes will be used whose configuration will be defined by the ID numbers of the students that make up the group. Once all the simulations have been carried out, the results obtained should be compared by analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each planning algorithm. As a result of this delivery, a report must be presented that indicates:
    1) Process configuration.
    2) Results obtained for each simulation.
    3) Comparison and analysis of the results obtained in each simulation.
## TP Delivery No 2: New Planner Proposal.
#### The objective is to propose a new type of process planner, which must have some different characteristic from those seen in class. Said proposal must be described indicating the possible benefits that it is thought to have, as well as include a pseudo-code that indicates its way of working. Based on this specification, each group must apply its proposal in the process configuration defined in the first delivery. Once the application has been completed, the results obtained must be analyzed and compared with those obtained in previous deliveries. As a result of this delivery, a report must be presented that indicates:
    1) Description of the new type of proposed process planner.
    2) Pseudo-code of the proposed new type of process scheduler.
    3) Results obtained by its application.
    4) Analysis of the results obtained.
    5) Comparison with the results in the previous simulation.

## TP Delivery No 1: Installation of the Distributed Environment.
#### The objective of this delivery is for students to install the “Rocks” operating system on at least 3 virtual machines (one being the master node and the rest the slave nodes). After configuring this environment, the group of students must present a report indicating the steps taken for the installation, the configuration of the environment used and the problems found with their corresponding solutions.
## TP Delivery No 2: Distributed Environment Stress Testing.
#### The objective of this delivery is to test the operation of the distributed system installed in the previous delivery using the available tools. Each group of students must perform at least 4 performance, load balancing and/or node outage tests in this environment and then present a report that indicates the objective of the test, its description, the results obtained in the environment along with its corresponding analysis. With these results, students must present a report that indicates:
    i. Configuration of the used environment.
    ii. For each test performed:
        · Objective of the test.
        · Description of the test carried out.
        · Screenshots.
        · Real results obtained in the environment.
    iii. Analysis of the tests carried out.
    iv. Conclusions of the work carried out.
